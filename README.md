It applies artistic styles to photographs, creating visually appealing stylized images.

Features:
1. Uses a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub for efficient style transfer.
2. Accepts a content image and a style image as inputs.
3. Supports JPEG,JPG and PNG image formats.
4. Outputs a new image that retains the structure of the content image while adopting the artistic style.
5. Supports visualization of original and stylized images.

Usage:
- Provide paths to a content image and a style image.
- The script processes the images and applies style transfer.
- The stylized image is displayed and saved as output.

This tool is useful for artistic image transformations and creative applications.
